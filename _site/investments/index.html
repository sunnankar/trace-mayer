      <h1 class="fw-bold display-4 main-h1 pb-3 pb-md-4 px-2">Investments</h1>
      <p class="px-2">There have been several blockchain related investments made. The general thesis is that there are seven network effects taking place with Bitcoin: (1) Speculation, (2) Merchants, (3) Consumers, (4) Security/Miners, (5) Developers, (6) Financailization and (7) Settlement Currency.</p>
      <p class="px-2">The investments are to start at the beginning of these network effects</p>
      <div class="row py-3">
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-armory.png" height="58" alt="Armory" />
            <div class="row py-3">Trace was an early investor in Armory, leading their seed round and supporting the company as it innovated on Cold Storage and Hierarchical Deterministic Multi-sig Wallets. Trace was early to identify the need for robust wallet software to support individuals in their desire to hold their own private keys. The investment in Armory paved the way for self-custody and enabling people to exert their monetary sovereignty.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-bitpay.png" height="58" alt="Bitpay" />
            <div class="row py-3">Trace invested in BitPay as part of the second Network Effect of Bitcoin, Merchant adoption. Any new form of money would necessarily need to serve as a medium of exchange for consumer/merchant transactions, and BitPay helped facilitate this as a merchant processor. They insulated the merchant from the price volatility risk, enabling a wide range of companies to accept Bitcoin without having to manage the FX risk.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-kraken.png" height="58" alt="Kraken" />
            <div class="row py-3">As Bitcoin continued to grow in 2011, Trace identified that Speculation would be important, and exchanges would be a critical piece of that infrastructure. He co-led Kraken's Series A with Hummingbird Ventures due to its focus on security at a time when most exchanges were getting hacked or compromised. Trace participated in Kraken funding in later rounds as well, supporting the company through its growth throughout the years. Kraken remains a critical piece of Bitcoin trading infrastructure, supporting retail and institutional participants around the world.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-bitcoin-mag.png" height="58" alt="Bitcoin Magazine" />
            <div class="row py-3">Trace recognized that Bitcoin adoption required a reliable source of bitcoin news and information. His investment in Bitcoin Magazine was in-line with this focus and helped drive mainstream education and adoption, championing monetary sovereignty and serving as a resource for newcomers and veterans alike.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-NYDIG.png" height="58" alt="NYDIG" />
            <div class="row py-3">Trace's 2020 investment in NYDIG was one of the first to drive institutionalization of bitcoin, supporting the Financialization network effect. NYDIG's unique positioning as a licensed custodian enabled them to offer custody and derivatives in a regulated manner that had not been done before. Trace continued to work with NYDIG over the years to innovate on their derivatives offering and expand it to other institutional products such as lending and repo.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-custodia.png" height="58" alt="Custodia Bank" />
            <div class="row py-3">In 2021, Trace led the way on the banking fight with his investment in Custodia Bank. Not long after, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 took hold, with the Fed blocking and ultimately shutting down banks that had served crypto companies. Trace is backing Custodia in their lawsuit against the Fed, ensuring that the government does not unjustly target banks and entities operating in the space.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="col-xl-4">
            <img src="/assets/images/investments/logo-RTX.png" height="58" alt="RTX" />
            <div class="row py-3">As the Financialization network effect continued to find its footing, Trace backed RTX, a registered Swap Dealer in the US. The investment in RTX has brought a technology-first approach to the arcane swaps market, transitioning from a predominantly voice broker model to an electronic market. Through the investment in RTX, Trace has helped bring principles of transparency and price discovery to the traditional markets.</div>
          </div>
        
      </div>
      <p class="px-2">To properly speculate the private keys must be properly secured hence the investment in Armory and to be traded there must be an exchange, Kraken.</p>
      <p class="px-2">
        In February 2016, after implementing innovations including <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet" target="_blank" class="text-link"> cold storage</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet" target="_blank" class="text-link">hierarchical deterministic wallets</a> ,<a href="https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/tutorials/armory-advanced-features/fragmented-backups/" target="_blank" class="text-link"> fragmented backups </a> and <a href="https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/tutorials/armory-advanced-features/lockbox/create-lockbox/" target="_blank" class="text-link">multi-sig implementations;</a> funding for <a href="https://btcarmory.com/armory-future/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Armory Technologies Incorporated discontinued development of the open source Bitcoin Armory software</a>  and future development was done via <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=97.0" target="_blank" class="text-link">goatpig </a> under the MIT license.
      </p>
      <p class="px-2">The easier it is for merchants to accept Bitcoin the more likely they will be to engage the services of a merchant processor like Bitpay. Trace supported bitcoin.org <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org/pull/1752" target="_blank" class="text-link">removing Bitpay for an unethical hard fork policy </a> which violated bitcoin.org's standards.</p>

				<p class="ps-2 pt-5">Bitcoin is an amazing technological innovation enabling the transfer of value over a communications channel. There are many different use cases for individuals to buy and hold Bitcoin.</p>
				<p class="ps-2 ">Understanding the job that needs to be done is critical for prioritizing what extensibility to focus on.</p>
				<h2 class="fw-bold display-4 pb-md-4 px-2 py-md-4">Major Categories For Hiring Bitcoin</h2>
				<p class="ps-2">
					<ul>
						<li>Secure Online Transactions</li>
						<li>Bail-Ins</li>
						<li>Negative Interest Rates</li>
						<li>Borderless</li>
						<li>Irreversible</li>
						<li>Deflation</li>
						<li>Programmable Money</li>
						<li>Multi-Signature</li>
						<li>Bitcoin 2.0</li>
						<li>Monetary Sovereignty</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h2 class="fw-bold display-4 pb-md-4 px-2 py-md-4">Monetary Sovereignty</h2>
				<p class="ps-2 pb-5">For example, mankind has never really owned their own money before. It's always been owned by their rulers. In the case of the United states that would be the Federal Reserve and it's board members. The Fed is not a part of government, but rather a private cabal. Even when our government had a currency actually backed by reserves it was only fractionally backed and therefore just an illusion. Bitcoin gives the ability for people to actually own their own money. You can't possibly own something if someone else can dilute the value of it by making more and taking it from you through inflation. With bitcoin the amount that will be created is known and that is it.</p>
