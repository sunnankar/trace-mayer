      <p>Starting in 2020, Trace&rsquo;s investments really started to climb. In Q4 2020, he helped <a href="https://www.nydig.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG)</a>, a Bitcoin-focused financial firm, scale and take off through his Series B funding.</p>
      <p>Following his NYDIG investment, he also</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Led the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/avanti-financial-raises-37-million-to-launch-institutional-crypto-bank" class="text-link" target="_blank">Custodia Bank</a> Series A funding (2021), a specialized digital asset bank</li>
        <li>Invested in <a href="https://wolfnyc.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">Wolf</a> (2023), a lightning incubator with NYDIG</li>
        <li>Invested in <a href="https://www.rtxfintech.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">RTX</a> (2023), a swap dealer focused on efficiency, liquidity, and dependability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While increasing his investing footprint during the wave of institutional adoption, Trace was also instrumental in driving forward regulatory progress. In March 2022, Utah Governor Cox signed the bill to create the Utah Blockchain Task Force. That same month, Trace was <a href="https://boards.utah.gov/s/board/related/a018y0000047HH3AAM/Board_Seats__r">appointed to the Utah Blockchain Task Force.</a></p>
      <p>His most recent investment and business venture was founding <a href="https://www.urimcapital.com/" class="text-link" target="_blank">Urim Capital</a> in 2022. This firm is focused on early-stage cryptocurrency related projects, real estate, and software development.</p>
      <p>In 2024, Trace had a cameo in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A06qdTpOYcg" class="text-link" target="_blank">"The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin"</a>, the first Bitcoin documentary.</p>

      <p>This is not the end for Trace, but rather a continuation of infinite possibilities.</p>
